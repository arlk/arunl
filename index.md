~~~<h1>About Me</h1>~~~

I am currently working as a software engineer at [Apple](https://www.apple.com) in the AIML group.

Before joining the industry, I completed my PhD from the University of Illinois, where I was advised by [Prof. Naira Hovakimyan](http://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/). Broadly, my research was at the intersection of robotics, control theory, and machine learning, where I focused on safe motion planning for robots under uncertainty. For a deeper overview of my work during the PhD, head over to the [research page](/research/). While at UIUC, I also spent a few summers working outside of academia towards robotics related problems at Facebook Reality Labs, Occipital, and Qualcomm.
