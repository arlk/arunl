I am currently working as a software engineer at Optimus Ride in the _Planning and Controls_ team where I focus development efforts on modern control techniques that provide rigorous safety arguments for self-driving vehicles.

Before joining the industry, I completed my PhD in the Advanced Controls Research Laboratory at the University of Illinois under the guidance of Prof. Naira Hovakimyan. Broadly, my research was at the intersection of robotics, control theory, and machine learning, where I focused on safe motion planning for robots under uncertainty.
While at UIUC, I also spent a few summers working outside of academia towards robotics related problems at Facebook Reality Labs, Occipital, and Qualcomm.
