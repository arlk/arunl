# About Me

I am currently working as a software engineer at [Optimus Ride](https://www.optimusride.com) in the _Planning and Controls_ team where I focus development efforts on modern control techniques that provide rigorous safety arguments for self-driving vehicles.

Before joining the industry, I completed my PhD from the University of Illinois, where I was advised by [Prof. Naira Hovakimyan](http://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/). Broadly, my research was at the intersection of robotics, control theory, and machine learning, where I focused on safe motion planning for robots under uncertainty. While at UIUC, I also spent a few summers working outside of academia towards robotics related problems at Facebook Reality Labs, Occipital, and Qualcomm.
