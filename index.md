~~~<h1>About Me</h1>~~~

I am currently working as a software engineer at [Optimus Ride](https://www.optimusride.com) in the _Planning and Controls_ team where I focus development efforts on modern control techniques that provide rigorous safety arguments for self-driving vehicles.

Before joining the industry, I completed my PhD from the University of Illinois, where I was advised by [Prof. Naira Hovakimyan](http://naira.mechse.illinois.edu/). Broadly, my research was at the intersection of robotics, control theory, and machine learning, where I focused on safe motion planning for robots under uncertainty. While at UIUC, I also spent a few summers working outside of academia towards robotics related problems at Facebook Reality Labs, Occipital, and Qualcomm.

~~~<h1>Experience</h1>~~~

### [Software Engineer at Optimus Ride](https://www.optimusride.com/)
~~~
<h5><i>Sep 2021 - present</i> (Boston, MA)</h5>
~~~
- Produced a design document rigorously detailing the safety requirements and the associated assumptions for an autonomous vehicle from a controls perspective.
- Documented the design of a model predictive control algorithm with computational, stability, and feasibility guarantees.

### [Research Intern at Facebook Reality Labs](https://about.facebook.com/realitylabs/)
~~~
<h5><i>May 2018 - Aug 2018</i> (Redmond, WA)</h5>
~~~
- Performed system identification for a controlled hardware device.
- Implemented a disturbance observer-based control augmented with a baseline PID control to compensate for disturbances injected into the system while accurately tracking reference signals.

### [Intern at Paracosm (a division of Occipital)](https://occipital.com/)
~~~
<h5><i>May 2017 - Jul 2017</i> (Gainesville, FL)</h5>
~~~
- Designed a C++ library for generic motion planners that allows for easily swapping between different types of motion planner for a wheeled robot mounted with a _Structure_ sensor.
- Implemented a computationally efficient distance transform of an occupancy map for fast collision checking and distance-based prioritization when planning.

### [Research Intern at Qualcomm Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/research)
~~~
<h5><i>May 2016 - Aug 2016</i> (Philadelphia, PA)</h5>
~~~
- Designed an obstacle avoidance controller for the _Snapdragon Flight_ board (since discontinued) for assistive collision prevention using noisy vision-based range information.
- Developed sampling-based motion planning algorithms to generate distance-optimal collision-free paths for the vehicle from a 3D occupancy map.
<!-- The software was designed to be as computationally efficient as possible to run seamlessly on the Snapdragon 801 chipset. -->
